# CS275H - Final Proposal
Tianyuan Wu, 63305667
##  Goal
- Implement a fluid simulator using SPH method
- Implement the interaction (coupling) between fluid and rigid bodies, such as cubes and balls
    - Show the influence of the fluid by the rigid body (one-way coupling)
- Implement a renderer of the particle system

## Implementation details
- Using C++ and OpenGL
- The rigid body part and part of the renderer will use third party libraries
- Using OpenMP for acceleration (multi-threading)
